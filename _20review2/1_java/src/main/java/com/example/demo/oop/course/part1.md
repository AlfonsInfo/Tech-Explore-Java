3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction

# Inheritance
1. Allows you to create new class based on another one
2. New class can extend xisting one and share properties and behaviour
3. New class is called child class and basic class is called parent class
4. Inheritance allows you to reuse code and to create new classes without reinventing the wheel
