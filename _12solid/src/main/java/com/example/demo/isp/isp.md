# Interface Segregation Principle

- Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use
- Write Highly Cohesive interfaces
- Dependency Inversion principle means that code should not create objects of all of its dependencies itself. Dependencies should be provided to the code from outside.
